DONE -	Initial cut at bootstrap logic
DONE -	Adjust tricks.S to deal with Y register
DONE -	Correct entry/exit SWI handling offsets for HC11
DONE	Save registers for HC11 interrupt handler
DONE	Correct I/O offsets for HC11
DONE	Change vector table for HC11
DONE -	Turn most of the HC11 lowlevel code into the 6303 codebase
DONE -	Use Y register for efficiency in copiers
NO	Do we need to save Y over a switch
DONE -	Align syscall handling with 6303 somehow (this is tricky due to the
	reversed arguments). May need to remember personality or something
	(eg ACCB = 0x80-0xFF = sane C argument passing with hole in odd place
	(as we will pshd for the one arg so it will be arg2 arg1 ret arg0 ...)
NO	Our 6303 code only uses xgdx from 6303, can we use the invalid instr
	trap to fix that up and have two 6303 flag bits (xgdx, bitops) so
	we can run more stuff nicely (and can make fixup handler swap the
	byte and restart it)

	(HC11 Y pefix is 6303 XGDX so not fixable 6303 binaries will not run
	on HC11)

-	Identify which of the library routines is miscompiling
-	Why do we run with kernel syscall trace on but not off
-	Timers
-	Signals
-	Move to 16K x 4 banking mode
-	Experiment with flat mode
