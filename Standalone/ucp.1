If the \fICOMMAND\fR argument is omitted, \fIUCP\fR starts an interactive

Print the synopsis and exit.

.TP
.BR exit ", " quit
Quit the program.

.TP
.BR dir ", " ls " [" \fIpath\fR "]"
List contents of the working directory, or \fIpath\fR if given.

.TP
.BR find " [" \fIpath\fR "]"
List files and directories in the working directory hierarchy, or \fIpath\fR
if given. If \fIpath\fR is / everything in the file system is listed.

.TP
.BR cd " <" \fIpath\fR ">"
Change the working directory to \fIpath\fR.

.TP
.BR mkdir " <" \fIpath\fR ">"
Create directory \fIpath\fR if it does not already exists.

.TP
.BR mknod " <" \fIname\fR ">" " <" \fImode\fR ">" " <" \fIdev#\fR ">"
Make a device named \fIname\fR, having \fImode\fR by an octal number
representing a permission bit pattern, and \fIdev#\fR number.

.TP
.BR chmod " <" \fImode\fR ">" " <" \fIpath\fR ">"
Change \fIpath\fR to \fImode\fR by an octal number representing a
permission bit pattern.

.TP
.BR bget ", " get " <" \fIhost-path\fR ">" " [" \fIfuzix-path\fR "]"
Copy file \fIhost-path\fR from the host file system into the Fuzix file system,
with the optional \fIfuzix-path\fR destination name. On Unix systems the
\fBbget\fR and \fBget\fR commands are identical, but on other systems
\fBbget\fR may treat files as binary, as opposed to \fBget\fR that may perform
a text conversion.

Remove the file \fIpath\fR.

.TP
.BR rmdir " <" \fIpath\fR ">"
Remove the directory \fIpath\fR, which must be empty.

.TP
.BR df
Report Fuzix file system space usage.
